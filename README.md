# odin-recipes
  This is a project from "The Odin Project" course
where I am tasked to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page, with
links to a few recipes. This
will demonstrate what I've learned in HTML (html 
boilerplate, creating an index page with headings
and links to the recipe pages, formatted recipe
pages with images of the finished dish), and now css.
