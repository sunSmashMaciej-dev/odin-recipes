        <p>
            <ul class="main">
                <li>3 tablespoons ground flax</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>3 cups chickpeas, <em>drained and 
                    rinsed</em> (this is how much is in 
                    2 cans of chickpeas)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, <em>or more to 
                    taste</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h2 class="inverted">Steps</h2></p>

        <p>
            <ol class="main">
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, stir together the ground 
                    flax and 1/2 cup water. Let sit for 5
                    minutes while you prepare the chickpeas.</li>
                <li>In a food processor with the "S" blade, add
                    chickpeas and pulse until there are almost
                    no whole beans left. If you do not have a 
                    food processor, you can mash them by hand 
                    with a potato masher. Add the processed
                    chickpeas to a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the flax/water mixture and the rest of 
                    the ingredients to the bowl. Stir with a 
                    large wooden spoon until well combined. 
                    The mixture will be very thick. <em>You can 
                    also just use your hands to make sure 
                    everything is incorporated well</em></li>
                <li>Roll into balls (about a heaping tablespoon 
                    each)and place on a parchment lined or
                    greased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Place in the oven and bake for 30-35 
                    minutes, turning once halfway through.</li>
                <li>While the meatballs are cooking, you can 
                    prepare whatever else you want to have them
                    with. Whether it's spaghetti and marinara or
                    cutting up bread for meatball subs, you have
                    plenty of time to prepare it!</li>
                <li>When the meatballs are done cooking, add 
                    them to the rest of your dish, make some 
                    subs, or just grab a fork and dig in!!!</li>
