        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) 12-ounce package jumbo shells</li>
                <li>(1) 26-ounce jar marinara sauce (about

                <li>2 cups raw cashews</li>
                <li>(1) 14-ounce firm tofu, <em>drained 
                    from package</em></li>
                <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 
                    1 large lemon)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>6-8 leaves fresh basil (or 2 teaspoons
                    dried)</li> 
                <li>2-3 sprigs fresh oregano, <em>removed 
                    from sprigs</em> (or 2 teaspoons dried)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>(1) 10-ounce package chopped frozen spinach, 
                    <em>thawed</em> (or 2-3 cups fresh)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li><strong>Boil the shells: </strong>Bring 
                    a large pot of water to a boil and add the 
                    jumbo shalls. Cook for 8-10 minutes, until 
                    done. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set 
                    aside. <em>Some will likely break, but you 
                    will only need about 3/4 of the package so 
                    it's okay.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Make the spinach ricotta:</strong> 
                    Add the cashews to a food processor, and 
                    process until fine and crumbly. Now add the 
                    rest of the ingredients EXCEPT the spinach 
                    and marinara sauce. Process until smooth and 
                    creamy, scraping the sides as needed. Now 
                    add the spinach, squeezing out excess water 
                    before adding. Pulse to combine.</li>
                <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread 
                    about 1 cup of the marinara sauce in the 
                    bottom.</li>
                <li><strong>Stuff the shells: </strong>Scoop 
                    about 2 tablespoons of the spinach ricotta 
                    into each shell and place open side up into 
                    baking dish. Repeat until all the filling 
                    is used up. <em>Stuffing the shells can be 
                    tricky, so don't worry if the first few 
                    get a bit mangled!</em></li>
                <li>Spoon remaining marinara sauce on top of 
                    the stuffed shells and place in the oven. 
                    Cook, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Serve 
                    immediately and enjoy!</li>
